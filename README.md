Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Pablo, an evolutionary biologist interested in animal cooperation and how animals adapt to, and are affected by, anthropogenic habitat change. 
I combine empirical studies in the field and lab, with research synthesis using meta-analysis.

In my GitHub you will find R packages and repositories to document my research.

You can also find me on Twitter [@p_capi](https://twitter.com/p_capi), 
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5JMTO-kAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and
